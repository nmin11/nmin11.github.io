      <description>TL;DR (Generated by Notion AI) While AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) has become a popular choice for infrastructure-as-code (IaC) development, it is important to note that it is not a silver bullet solution for all use cases.
Firstly, AWS CDK may not be the best choice for smaller projects or simple infrastructure setups that do not require a lot of customization. In such cases, using a simpler IaC tool or even writing code directly in the AWS console may be more efficient.</description>

      <title>Mysterious S3 Access Denied Error</title>

      <description>How I discovered the error I actually encountered the same error twice.
Neither error occurred in the course of work, but both occurred on the side projects that I had implemented a feature to test work-related functionality.
What I implemented was a Lambda function that triggered by S3 object created event.
These Lambda functions had a common logic: get the object&amp;rsquo;s key name from the received event, and look up the object information again via that key name.</description>

      <description>0. What is Github Pages? Github Pages is a useful tool that allows us to create our own website for free without a server or DB.
It is widely used not only for blogs but also for resumes, portfolios, official documents, galleries, and archives.
(Especially, many developer create portfolio with Github Pages.)
I also chose Github Pages because I wanted to create a new tech blog!
