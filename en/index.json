In such cases, using a simpler IaC tool or even writing code directly in the AWS console may be more efficient.","date":"2023-08-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://nmin11.github.io/en/blog/aws-cdk-is-not-a-silver-bullet/","tags":["aws","iac","cdk"],"title":"AWS CDK is not a silver bullet"},{"author":"Loko","categories":null,"contents":"How I discovered the error I actually encountered the same error twice.\nNeither error occurred in the course of work, but both occurred on the side projects that I had implemented a feature to test work-related functionality.\nWhat I implemented was a Lambda function that triggered by S3 object created event.\nThese Lambda functions had a common logic: get the object\u0026rsquo;s key name from the received event, and look up the object information again via that key name.","date":"2024-01-04T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://nmin11.github.io/en/blog/s3-access-denied-error/","tags":["aws","go","troubleshooting"],"title":"Mysterious S3 Access Denied Error"},{"author":"Loko","categories":null,"contents":"0.
