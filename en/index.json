Introduction: IDE Proficiency Directly Impacts Productivity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the era of vi, which involved editing text in terminals, GUI-based IDEs like Turbo Pascal and Visual Basic began to emerge in the 1980s.\nFurthermore, modern IDEs that appeared after the 2000s, such as VS Code, Eclipse, and IntelliJ, evolved beyond mere \u0026rsquo;editors\u0026rsquo; by supporting code auto-completion, real-time error checking, project management, version control integration, and refactoring tools, transforming IDEs into intelligent tools.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s IDEs contain decades of accumulated know-how for boosting developer productivity.\nEven now, as AI Code Generation capabilities continue to expand, IDE proficiency remains essential for editing and fine-tuning the vast amounts of code that AI produces.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I decided to write this post to reassess my own IDE skills at this particular moment.\u003c/p\u003e","date":"2026-01-27T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://nmin11.github.io/en/blog/7-lets-learn-intellij-idea/","title":"Let's Learn IntelliJ IDEA"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\u003ch2 id=\"0-introduction\"\u003e0.
